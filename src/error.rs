//! The canonical control-plane error taxonomy.
//!
//! One definition point for every error code a dig-node control method emits, the [`ControlError`]
//! envelope (`{code, message, data:{code, origin}}`), and the constructor both sides use so every
//! error carries a machine-branchable `data.code` (UPPER_SNAKE) and `data.origin`.
//!
//! The numeric values are the SAME published wire contract as dig-node's `meta::ErrorCode` and the
//! canonical dig-rpc `-320xx` control range — they never change once assigned. A client keys its UX
//! off `data.code` (the stable symbol), never the human `message`.
//!
//! | Code | Variant | Origin | Meaning |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `-32700` | [`ParseError`](ControlErrorCode::ParseError) | shell | request body was not valid JSON |
//! | `-32600` | [`InvalidRequest`](ControlErrorCode::InvalidRequest) | shell | not a single JSON-RPC object |
//! | `-32601` | [`MethodNotFound`](ControlErrorCode::MethodNotFound) | boundary | control method is not resolved |
//! | `-32602` | [`InvalidParams`](ControlErrorCode::InvalidParams) | node | missing/malformed params |
//! | `-32000` | [`DispatchFailed`](ControlErrorCode::DispatchFailed) | shell | the node failed to dispatch |
//! | `-32030` | [`Unauthorized`](ControlErrorCode::Unauthorized) | shell | called without a valid control token |
//! | `-32031` | [`NotSupported`](ControlErrorCode::NotSupported) | shell | control op unsupported on this build |
//! | `-32032` | [`ControlError`](ControlErrorCode::ControlError) | shell | control op failed at runtime |
//! | `-32040` | [`WalletNoChainSource`](ControlErrorCode::WalletNoChainSource) | node | no live chain source could answer |
//! | `-32041` | [`WalletNotSynced`](ControlErrorCode::WalletNotSynced) | node | the local replica is still syncing |
//! | `-32042` | [`WalletReadFailed`](ControlErrorCode::WalletReadFailed) | node | the read failed at the DB / chain layer |
//! | `-32043` | [`WalletRateLimited`](ControlErrorCode::WalletRateLimited) | node | the open fallback rate bound is exhausted |
//! | `-32044` | [`WalletNodeSpendDisabled`](ControlErrorCode::WalletNodeSpendDisabled) | node | the bundle spends the NODE's own coins and live broadcast is off |
//! | `-32046` | [`WalletCoinsReserved`](ControlErrorCode::WalletCoinsReserved) | node | coins are held by an in-flight spend |
//! | `-32047` | [`WalletReservationsUnavailable`](ControlErrorCode::WalletReservationsUnavailable) | node | the reservation set could not be read |
//! | `-32048` | [`SpendAuditUnreadable`](ControlErrorCode::SpendAuditUnreadable) | shell | the automated-spend audit record could not be read |
//!
//! The `-3204x` block is OWNED BY THIS CRATE. A node or client MUST NOT mint a code in it that is
//! not declared here: a privately-minted code is invisible to allocation, and two implementations
//! then disagree about what one number means. `-32044` is the worked example — it was minted in
//! dig-node for a permanent custody refusal and, independently, here for a transient wait, so a
//! client conflating them either retries forever on a refusal or gives up on a wait.
