//! The two contract traits: the client-facing call builder/parser and the node-facing handler.
//!
//! * [`ControlCall`] binds a typed params struct to its [`ControlMethod`] and its typed result — so
//!   a caller writes `client.request(&SetCapParams { cap_bytes })` and gets back a `SetCapResult`,
//!   never a stringly-typed `Value`.
//! * [`ControlClient`] is what a CLIENT depends on: build a JSON-RPC request from a typed call, and
//!   parse a response back into the typed result (or a [`ControlError`]). Pure — no transport; the
//!   consumer carries the bytes over dig-ipc / loopback-mTLS itself.
//! * [`ControlHandler`] is what a NODE implements to SERVE the surface: one typed method per control
//!   method, plus a provided [`dispatch`](ControlHandler::dispatch) that routes a raw request to the
//!   right method — the single anti-drift seam the conformance KATs exercise.
