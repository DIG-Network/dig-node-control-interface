//! The canonical control-method catalog.
//!
//! [`ControlMethod`] enumerates every method a client can send to a running dig-node's CONTROL
//! plane, its stable wire name, whether it requires the local control token, whether it is a
//! pairing-administration method (which requires the MASTER token specifically), and how the node
//! routes it (owned by the service shell, delegated to the embedded node engine, or an open
//! pairing-bootstrap method reachable without a token).
//!
//! This is the SINGLE source of truth for "what can be controlled". The node dispatchers, the
//! client SDKs (CLI `dign`, the extension, dig-app, hub), the OpenRPC/discovery surface, and the
//! conformance KATs all read this one table, so the method set can never drift between them.
//!
//! Mirrors the live dig-node surface: the shell-owned methods in
//! `dig-node-service/src/control.rs` (`CONTROL_METHODS`) plus the peer/subscription methods
//! delegated to `dig-node-core` (`control.peerStatus` / `control.peers.*` / `control.subscribe`
//! / `control.unsubscribe` / `control.listSubscriptions`), and the two OPEN pairing-bootstrap
//! methods (`pairing.request` / `pairing.poll`) a token-less MV3 extension uses to obtain a
//! scoped token after local operator approval.
